# standard_deviation
## A standard deviation calculator I wrote in Python.

I took a Probability and Statistics course in the Spring 2021 semester, and among the many topics I've learned in the course, one of those topics that stood out was standard deviation. When doing the whole process on paper, I personally believed it was a lot of work and values to keep track of. As a result, I decided to write an algorithm that imitated the whole process of standard deviation based on my knowledge of the Python programming language at the time.

As a bonus, I added the option to find the median and range of the set of values inputted.
